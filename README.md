Project Sekai Tiering Rank Cutoffs
I choose to make a scatter plot as it would best represent my data. I wanted to show each character on the X-axis as well as show the amount of points earned. This makes it very easy to visualize. For people who are thinking about playing, they can easily view previous events and have an idea of how competitive they are going to be. The audience, based on their use case, can also change between tiers depending on the one that they plan to compete for.
The variables I choose were:
Event ID: To identify the corresponding event number and sequence
Event name: To identify the exact event
Focus Unit: To know whose event was taking place
Cutoff Points: Variables were created for T1, T10, T20, T30, T40, T50, T100, T200, T300, T400, T500, and T1000 cutoffs. These are genuinely the most coveted ranks because of the rewards given.
While the data itself had some errors, it was eye opening to see how much more popular certain characters were over others.
